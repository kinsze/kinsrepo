            <h2>Choy Li Fut kung fu classes</h2>
            <p>
                Choy Li Fut Kung Fu (also Choi Lee Fut)
                is a highly-effective martial art with a rich,
                storied history. Chan Heung, born in 1806 in King
                Mui village in Guangdong province in Southern China,
                created Choy Li Fut by blending the kung fu techniques
                he learnt from Choy Fook, Li Yau San and his uncle Chan
                Yuen Woo. Further adaptations were created by Jeong Yim,
                who learned the art directly from Chan Heung. Later, the Choy
                Li Fut Kung Fu system was further adapted by Tarm Sam

            <h2>There are three main branches to Choy Li Fut</h2>

                </li>
                <li>
                    The lineage under Jeong Yim (also nicknamed Jeong Hung Sing
                    by his second teacher, Ching Cho) is called Hung Sing (鴻勝蔡李佛)
                    – Grand Victory Choy Li Fut or Goose Victory Choy Li Fut.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tarm Sam created the Bak Sing Choy Li Fut (北勝蔡李佛)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Developed over nearly two centuries, Choy Li Fut merges the agile
                footwork characteristic of martial arts in Northern China with powerful
                arm movements typical of Southern China and Buddhist Palm Style.
