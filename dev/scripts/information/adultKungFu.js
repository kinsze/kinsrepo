            <p>
                Choy Li Fut Kung Fu (also Choi Lee Fut)
                is a highly-effective martial art with a rich,
                storied history. Chan Heung, born in 1806 in King
                Mui village in Guangdong province in Southern China,
                created Choy Li Fut by blending the kung fu techniques
                he learnt from Choy Fook, Li Yau San and his uncle Chan
                Yuen Woo. Further adaptations were created by Jeong Yim,
                who learned the art directly from Chan Heung. Later, the Choy
                Li Fut Kung Fu system was further adapted by Tarm Sam

                Developed over nearly two centuries, Choy Li Fut merges the agile
                footwork characteristic of martial arts in Northern China with powerful
                arm movements typical of Southern China and Buddhist Palm Style.
